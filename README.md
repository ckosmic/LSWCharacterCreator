# LSW Character Creator

LSW Character Creator is a tool that lets you quickly and easily create modded characters for LEGO Star Wars: The Complete Saga.  It handles creating the character directory and its files, putting the character information in the collection/language files, and of course allows for editing character properties, animations, sounds, textures, and icons. \
Note that this program is still new and may crash at times.  It probably doesn't help that the whole thing is spaghetti code either, but for the most part, it works great for getting the job done.

## Installation

Download the release .zip and run LSWCharacterCreator.exe. \
For previewing your character model in Noesis, download both [Noesis](http://richwhitehouse.com/index.php?content=inc_projects.php&showproject=91) and the [.GHG importer for Noesis](https://www.rockraidersunited.com/topic/6759-noesis-script-for-ghg-files/) by Sluicer.  Place the .GHG importer script into Noesis's plugins/python directory.
