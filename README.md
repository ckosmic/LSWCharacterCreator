LSW Character Creator is a tool that lets you quickly and easily create modded characters for LEGO Star Wars: The Complete Saga.  It handles creating the character directory and its files, putting the character information in the collection/language files, and of course allows for editing character properties, animations, sounds, textures, and icons.

## Installation

Download the release .zip and run LSWCharacterCreator.exe. \
